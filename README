BT Home Hub 5 Type A firmware modification scripts
--------------------------------------------------

Included scripts can be used to download and modify stock BT Home Hub 5 Type A
firmware.

BT Home Hub 5 Type A routers are generally well supported by OpenWrt.
Unfortunately there is no hardware offload support in OpenWrt and throughput is
a bit limited.

Stock firmware has great Wi-Fi <-> LAN throughput (~450Mbps) but its admin ui
is restricted.

Included scripts can be used to prepare firmware images that have SSH enabled.
SSH access makes it possible to use OpenRG CLI (ssh_cli) and access all hidden
configuration options:

BT Home Hub 5A> help

Flashing the firmware
---------------------

Generated firmware images are not signed or encrypted. UART access and tftp
server are required for flashing.

I did the following to flash my router:

- restore stock BT firmware using 'restore' script from mkresin's
  BTHH5a-installimage, keep bootloader unlocked (router was previously running
  OpenWrt)

- boot modified OpenRG firmware over tftp

  tftpboot 0x81000000 OpenRG-modified.bin.lzma; bootm 0x81000000

- Reset firmware config - this will enable SSH service. Router will reboot.
  Interrupt boot process and boot the same image over tftp again.

- SSH in as admin and run the following commands to write firmware image to
  UbiFS 'OpenRG' volume. The volume normally contains two encrypted firmware
  images. We are writing single unencrypted image to it.

  cd /tmp && /mnt/cramfs/bin/wget http://x.x.x.x:8000/OpenRG-modified.bin.lzma && \
    ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_1 -t && \
    ubiupdatevol /dev/ubi0_1 OpenRG-modified.bin.lzma && \
    echo system reboot | ssh_cli
    
  Equivalent commands can be used to flash the image when running
  BTHH5a-installimage

- Interrupt boot process. Update bootcmd variable.

  printenv bootcmd

  setenv bootcmd 'ubi part UBI; ubi read $(loadaddr) OpenRG; bootm $(loadaddr)'
  saveenv

  # to restore default bootcmd in the future:
  # setenv bootcmd 'ubi part UBI; dualimage; bootm $(openrg_start)'
  # saveenv

- Power-cycle the device to boot modified firmware from flash
